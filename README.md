In this project, I used Python to scrape demographic information about countries from Wikipedia and compiled it into a dataset. By leveraging the power of web scraping, I was able to extract relevant information from Wikipedia pages and transform it into a structured format that can be easily analyzed and visualized.

The dataset I created contains a wide range of demographic indicators for each country, including population, grwoth rate, birth rate, and more. This information can be used to gain insights into the characteristics of different countries and to identify trends and patterns in global demographics.

To accomplish this, I used the BeautifulSoup library to extract data from HTML pages and Pandas to organize the data into a tabular format. The resulting dataset is stored in a CSV file that can be easily accessed and analyzed using a variety of data analysis tools.
